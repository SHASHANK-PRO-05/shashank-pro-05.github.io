### Blue Dolphin Cloud
<div style="text-align:justify;">
The cloud has two parts, REST API which helps in interaction with the world and Big Data Analytics Engine. I am the core engineer for both the parts

API is built with NodeJS module, Restify. To ensure the security of access it has the Oauth2 level which has the Access and Refresh token mechanism. To cache the data, Redis cluster is used, and the database behind is MongoDB. Both web and mobile apps communicate with this API with Amazon API gateway in the middle. It runs on Elastic BeanStalk environment. It also supports email-verification, push-notification, and mobile verification.

Analytics engine runs on Apache-Spark, Kinesis, MongoDB, and Amazon EMR. This tool is responsible for building analytics for the data generated from the API.

Details of inside work can be shared on request.

### SVAR
<div style="text-align:justify;">
This product is used to assess the English speaking skills of the candidate. The product on telephone lines, VoIP and computer. In this product, there are two modules scoring and delivery. I was the core engineer of this product. I handled all the maintenance and enhancement jobs for this product. Maintaining the server was also an added task for me as knowledge of Asterisk is required for it, and server admins are not aware of the Asterisk tool. Managing the version control for this system, setting up a testing or new server for the product, these are the few important tasks that can be mentioned. I also handled client requests for this product. It is built on the top of PHP, FreePBX, and Asterisk.</div>

### SVAR Tool
<div style="text-align:justify;">
As the client requests were increasing in SVAR there was a need felt to built a tool which will help the Client team to process the query as early as possible.  I took the initiative for this product. I had built the entire backend for this product.  In this product, I also initiated the use of frameworks in SVAR system. After discussion with my manager, I took Codeigniter framework for this. This system was built on a master- slave  architecture. It linked 6 servers altogether. It had all the data collecting mechanisms. I also built some visualisations for the data. This is built on PHP, CodeIgniter and mechanism used is the heartbeat.

### Automata
<div style="text-align:justify;">
This product is used by the company to judge the coding skill of a candidate. Like the online judge environment, this is a tool build for compiling in a constrained environment. On the basis of the compiling parameters, the code of the test taker is judged. This is what we see in coding websites, but the added feature in this is that machine learning algorithms provide a more detailed insight. My job was to revamp the system in such a way that production and delivery system were synced up -- as, initially, separate codes were running on both the systems. Entire task was mine. For this system, I also built a Health Script which defined whether the system is working properly or not. Also, this script did a rigorous data analysis on the database. The output was designed in such a way that it can be used for visualisation.

### Indian Railway's visualisation engine
<div style="text-align:justify;">
Indian Railway services have decided to update the infrastructure of the service. New technologies are introduced in the system and a lot of data will be produced from this new infrastructure. This project aims to provide Data Visualization for that data.  I worked on many types of visualisations which improved Human Computer Interaction. Some of them are Train Delay Charts, Time Table, Intersection on arrival and departure, Stacked and Bar Chart and Heat Map. The were all written in Data Driven Document script (D3.js).
