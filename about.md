Hi, I am Shashank Kapoor and I am a B.tech graduate from Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Engineering. I have started working on competitive programming. During this training, whatever I will learn, I will share that on this blog. I will try to work on Spark as well and will share insights with you. 

I am interested in learning two things, algos and distributed computing. So, if you are looking for something like that or are even interested in practicing and studying together, you are most welcome to join me. 

FYI: This blog is purely technical and is just to share my daily learnings. If that learnings help in any sought of way,  enjoy!!
