I am sorry if this website looks plagiarized. I am new to Jekyll. I will try to learn the details and will try to update this blog with new style. Till then bear with me.

#Learning Jekyll
If you want to learn about Jekyll, check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].

If you want a different taste than Jekyll, go for Pelican. It is a Python-based cousin of Jekyll. You can find it at [Pelican Blog][pelican]. I chose Jekyll because this is used by Github pages and since, I am posting on Github pages, it looks a nice choice to work with.
