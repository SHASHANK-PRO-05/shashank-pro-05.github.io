Ahh, 2016. Let us make this year count. If you want to be a good programmer, well, you will have to make programs for that. Get a lot of practical knowledge. If you say let us do it for  2 days or 2 months and we will solve the problems easly, well, you are wrong. It is mind boggling and you will not get it in such a short time span. Practice it every day. After 15 days of rigorous programming, I can say I have not learned even 1 percent. After doing 8 parts of code monk and numerous other problems, for which I don't even have a count, I still don't feel confident at all. Still there is more to learn. I have decided to learn things in parts. So what I have done is I have got an awesome book called programming challenges. From this, I will begin with number theory and do a lot of programs related to it. Most of the problems I will be doing will be from hacker earth and code chef and of course what book recommends me do. 

I also told that I will be working in spark. Well for that I will be learning Scala this month. It's hectic but doable. I might change my competitive programming language to Scala. Since, it is less verbose, my code typing will increase. 

When 2017 comes, I want to say, yes, I am a proficient programmer and a good learner, I have solved problems of the coding world, my code is being counted in open source community. 

That's all I will be writing in this post.
